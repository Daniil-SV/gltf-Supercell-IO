Introduction
------------
Custom extension for Official Khronos Group Blender [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) 2.0 importer and exporter

The goal of this project is to add support for Supercell glTF files to Blender using features of official Blender glTF importer
Essentially, it is a reimagined version of [Flat Converter](https://github.com/Daniil-SV/Supercell-Flat-Converter), but more convenient and accessible
